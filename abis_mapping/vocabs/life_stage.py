        "seeds. Spores are usually haploid and unicellular and are produced by "
        "meiosis in the sporangium by the sporophyte. Once conditions are "
        "favorable, the spore can develop into a new organism using mitotic "
        "division, producing a multicellular gametophyte, which eventually goes on "
        "to produce gametes. Many ferns, especially those adapted to dry "
        "conditions, produce diploid spores. In this case spores are the units of "
        "asexual reproduction, because a single spore develops into a new "
